# Libraries

They are groups of functions and code which can be used by us.
Some are built in and some are more extensive and will need to be brought in by pip.

All the core libraries: https://docs.python.org/3/library/

## Functions

A block of code that can be reused later on in the program. Makes the programme dry. It starts with def.
You can pass arguments / parameters to the function.

```python
def print_something():
    print("Something has been printed")
```

### Good practices

- Clear names
- Arguments should be obvious
- Remember return
- Use comments
- Type hints
